AI-Powered Plagiarism Checker
1. **Problem Statement**
Academic integrity and original content creation are vital in education, research, and content creation. However, plagiarism—whether intentional or accidental—poses ethical and legal challenges. Traditional plagiarism tools are often costly, inaccessible, or functionally limited. Plagir aims to offer a lightweight, open-source, accessible solution that helps users detect and address plagiarism quickly and effectively.

3 . **Current Progress Status**
The frontend prototype is complete, with the UI already live at plagir.netlify.app
The core functionality is implemented, allowing users to input text, upload files, and run similarity detection through internal or external APIs. However, several enhancements are still in progress. Around 25% of the similarity highlighting and report UI is pending, while support for additional file formats such as DOCX and PDF is approximately 50% complete. Features like exportable plagiarism reports (PDF/CSV) are yet to be implemented. The backend matching logic is being enhanced and performance tuning is ongoing, and some minor improvements in mobile responsiveness and overall UI/UX polishing remain to be completed.
